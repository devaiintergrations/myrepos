## Reporting a Vulnerability
Let us know as soon as possible upon discovery of a potential security issue, and we'll make every effort to quickly resolve the issue. Please bear in mind we're a project run entirely by volunteers in our spare time.
Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service. Only interact with accounts you own or with our explicit permission.
