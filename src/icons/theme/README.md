qBittorrent Theme Icons
------------------------------------------

# Previous
Initial `qbt-theme` icons created by Bert Verhelst (<verhelstbert@gmail.com>).

Icons are based on the `Font-Awesome` icon-set: [link](http://fontawesome.io/icons/).

If you need to add an icon that qBittorrent does not already use, you can take an icon from the SVG fork of `Font-Awesome`: [link](https://github.com/encharm/Font-Awesome-SVG-PNG).

# Redesign

Redesigned `theme` icons are created by Nowshed H. Imran (<now.im.627@gmail.com>).

Current icons are based on `la-capitaine` icon-theme: [link](https://github.com/keeferrourke/la-capitaine-icon-theme)

`la-capitaine` project is owned by Keefer Rourke and he has given his permission to use the icons to be used in qBittorrent project. Get an icon from there if needed.

# Color RGBA

Here is the following folowing color RGBA used for icon uniformity.

Blue          4285f4ff

# Icon Optimization

In order to optimize the icons `svgcleaner` has been used. [link](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/SVGCleaner)
It is recommended to use as this doesn't break icons while optimizing.
