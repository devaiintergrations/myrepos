# Design Guideline

This is a guideline for future icon designers who want to make improvements on this project.

1. All of the icons used this project has been taken from [la-capitaine-icon-theme](https://github.com/keeferrourke/la-capitaine-icon-theme). So, for the consistency of the whole application take icons from there if possible. Note that, Only cookies and Bug icon has been collected from [papirus-icon-theme](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme)

2. As all these icons will be downsized in the application, creating complicated and gradient filled icons will most likely waste your time. Simple shape works the best.

3. The Icon canvas size has been set as 32*32 pixels. This may seem like overkill but HDPi displays need them and this step future proofs the icons.

4. For the sake of simplicity, consistency and ease of designing only 6 color has been used on most of the icons. They are:



| Color           | RGB           |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|
| Green (light)   | 2ecc71ff      |
| Green (deep)    | 1ea95dff      |
| Red             | da4453ff      |
| Blue            | 1d99f3ff      |
| Yelow           | fdbc4bff      |
| Orange          | f47750ff      |


5. Here is the icon content size:

* For Square Icons: 28*28 pixel
* For Rectangular Icons(Horizontal): 30*23 pixel
* For Rectangular Icons(Vertical): 23*30 pixel
* For Special Rectangular Icons(example: Warning Icon): 6*28 Pixels
