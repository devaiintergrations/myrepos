# qBittorrent Icons
------------------------------------------

## Previous
Initial `qbt-theme` icons were created by Bert Verhelst (<verhelstbert@gmail.com>).

Icons were based on the [Font-Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) icon set.

## Redesign

Redesigned icons are created by Nowshed H. Imran (<now.im.627@gmail.com>).

New icons are based on [la-capitaine-icon-theme](https://github.com/keeferrourke/la-capitaine-icon-theme).

`la-capitaine` project is owned by Keefer Rourke and he has given his permission to use the icons to be used in qBittorrent project. Get an icon from there if needed.

It is recommended to use as optimization is very promising without any icon breakages.
