# qBittorrent Icons
------------------------------------------

## Previous
Initial `qbt-theme` icons were created by Bert Verhelst (<verhelstbert@gmail.com>).

Icons were based on the [Font-Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) icon set.

## Redesign

Redesigned icons are created by Nowshed H. Imran (<now.im.627@gmail.com>).

New icons are based on [la-capitaine-icon-theme](https://github.com/keeferrourke/la-capitaine-icon-theme).

`la-capitaine` project is owned by Keefer Rourke and due permission was received before modifying them. Get an icon from there if needed. 

## Color RGBA

Here is the following folowing color RGBA used for icon uniformity.

|:----------------:|:----------------:|
|     Blue         |     4285f4ff     |
|     Red          |     db3236ff     |
|     Green(Deep)  |     0fbb58ff     |
|     Green(Light) |     6cc24aff     |

## Icon Optimization

In order to optimize the icons [svgcleaner](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/SVGCleaner) has been used.
Submit the icon without optimization first and after that, submit the optimized one.
It is recommended to use "Svgcleaner" as optimization tool, as it almost never breaks any icon.
